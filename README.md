# python-textured-raycaster
A textured raycaster implemented in Python using pygame

This is a close implementation of this guide, for my personal study: https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html

It doesn't pretend to be (and it is certainly not) a high-performance implementation.

I share it here in case this helps others.

You can do what you want with it.
